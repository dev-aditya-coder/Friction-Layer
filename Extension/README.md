# FrictionLayer — Search Filter + Category/Keyword Feed Blocker

A Chrome extension prototype with two independent features:

- **Search Filter:** estimates relevance on supported search engines and YouTube Search.
- **YouTube Feed Filter:** on YouTube Home/recommendation surfaces, hides visible feed cards when their title or visible metadata matches one of the selected block categories (Study, Research, Work, Entertainment) or a custom keyword/phrase.

## Install
1. Extract this ZIP.
2. Open `chrome://extensions` in Chrome.
3. Enable **Developer mode**.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted `FrictionLayer-Universal-Search-Filter` folder.
5. Open YouTube, open the FrictionLayer extension popup, enable **YouTube feed filter**, select categories and/or enter comma-separated keywords, then click **Save feed settings**.

## Important prototype limits
- Category matching is a transparent list of keywords, not an AI classifier. It can miss relevant videos or hide unrelated ones.
- It inspects visible titles/channel/description metadata; it does not analyze the full video or transcript.
- YouTube Search results (`/results`) are left to the separate Search Filter.
- Videos/Shorts separation is intentionally not part of this version.
- The `Restore feed` control restores items hidden by the feed filter for the current page.


## Feed Filter behavior
The Feed Filter now works as an allowlist: when enabled and one or more categories/keywords are selected, only cards matching at least one selected category or keyword remain visible. If no categories are selected, the full feed is shown. Category matching is heuristic keyword matching against visible titles and metadata, not AI classification. YouTube search results remain reserved for the separate Search Filter.


## Feed Filter categories (v0.3.0)
The allowlist now offers Study, Gaming, Music, Sports, News, Movies & TV, Technology, and Entertainment. Entertainment's keyword list intentionally excludes gaming, music, and sports so those can be selected independently. Category detection remains title/metadata keyword matching, not semantic AI.

The YouTube Search Filter content script is injected on all YouTube pages and stays active across YouTube's single-page navigation, so navigating from Home to Search should not lose the search feature.


## Independent Videos / Shorts filter (v0.4.0)
- A separate popup section controls regular YouTube videos versus Shorts; it is not part of the category Feed Filter settings.
- Enable the section and select Videos only, Shorts only, or both. If neither type checkbox is selected, the type filter leaves content unchanged.
- The type filter runs on Home, recommendation feeds and (since v0.6.1) YouTube search results, where it hides Shorts shelves and Shorts listed as results (Videos only) or regular videos (Shorts only). It never touches the Shorts player page itself.
- YouTube's DOM changes frequently; test the behavior in Chrome on Home and recommendation feeds.


## Floating Focus Timer (v0.5.1)
- The companion timer overlay appears automatically when a session is started from the FrictionLayer website's `focus.html` page. The extension uses both a registered content script and a navigation-triggered fallback injector for ordinary HTTP/HTTPS websites.
- It floats above ordinary Chrome webpages, including YouTube, Google, and documentation sites. Chrome internal pages and the Chrome Web Store do not allow content-script overlays.
- The overlay has Pause/Resume, End, and Minimize controls. The session is stored in `chrome.storage.local`, so it continues when the website tab is closed or you move between tabs.
- The website and extension exchange session state through `window.postMessage` using the `frictionlayer-focus-session` / `frictionlayer-focus-overlay` message names. This bridge is a prototype; before production distribution, restrict accepted website origins to the official FrictionLayer domain and review the extension's broad `<all_urls>` permission.
- To enable the overlay, replace/reload the extension at `chrome://extensions` (select the folder that directly contains `manifest.json`), then open the website using a local HTTP server (such as VS Code Live Server) or its deployed HTTPS URL. Start a session on `focus.html`; the overlay should appear automatically on all ordinary Chrome tabs where the extension is enabled.


## Extension icon (v0.5.3)
The toolbar and extension-management icons use the FrictionLayer Layered F teal/blue mark in `icons/`.


## Session-only customization (v0.6.0)
Website customization (goal, strictness, filter toggles) now applies only while a Focus Session is running or paused. When a session starts, the extension backs up its own Search/Feed filter settings and applies the website customization temporarily. When the timer completes, the session is ended, or it is dismissed, the backup is restored (also if the browser was closed when the timer ran out). Saving preferences on customize.html no longer changes the extension's own settings. Edits made in the popup during a session are kept and restored afterwards.


## v0.6.1
- Videos & Shorts filter now also works on YouTube search results; hidden items are restored correctly when you switch between Videos, Shorts and both.
